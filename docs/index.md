ICB (Internet Citizen's Band) is an early Internet teleconferencing program.  It allows clients across the Internet to communicate. ICB was first released in 1989.

You find a brief history of ICB and a list of related software on the [official website](http://www.icb.net).

This server hosts an ICB server called [Fuchsschwanz](https://github.com/20centaurifux/fuchsschwanz) which was written in 2019. Feel free to connect to the service and chat with other people.
